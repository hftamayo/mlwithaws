The first 150 to successfully complete the free course will receive an AWS DeepLens device. We’ll also give $35 AWS credits to the first 2,500 who enroll in the course, for use in training AWS DeepRacer, for competition in the AWS DeepRacer League. Finally, learners will receive instructions to take an online assessment quiz that will be used to select the top scorers who will receive a full scholarship for Udacity’s popular AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program.

Phase 2: Full Scholarship for a Udacity Nanodegree program
425 Scholarship participants who complete all program content and receive top scores from the online assessment quiz from the foundational program will earn a scholarship to the AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program. Nanodegree programs typically require several hours of work per week for the duration of the Nanodegree program, from October 25, 2021 through January 25, 2022. This program will offer world-class curriculum, a groundbreaking classroom experience, industry leading instructors, thorough project reviews and a full suite of career services.
